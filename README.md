## Project Description

This Android application enables users to post, track, and share their moods. Designed to help participants reflect on and understand their emotional states and triggers, the app supports capturing mood events with details such as date/time, emotional state, reason (text or photo), and social situation. Users can view and filter a personal mood history, edit or delete past moods, and optionally attach a location to each entry. The application also provides a follow feature, allowing participants to view and filter the recent mood events of others who grant them permission. 

## Key Features

Mood Event Tracking: Easily create and manage mood entries that include date/time, emotional state, and optional details like triggers and social context. This logging system allows users to maintain a record of their emotional well-being.

Follow & Share: Connect with others by requesting permission to follow their recent mood events. Keep track of how friends or peers are feeling. 

Location & Map Views: Optionally attach a location to each mood entry, and visualize mood events on an integrated map. This feature helps users understand where certain emotional states occur.

Offline Mode: Users can add, edit, or delete mood events while offline. Any changes will automatically synchronize once an internet connection is restored.
